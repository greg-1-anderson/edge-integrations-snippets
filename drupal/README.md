# Sample Drupal modules

Drupal modules demonstrating various approaches on how to leverage Pantheon Edge Integrations personalization features.

## Description

Each subdirectory is meant to be an individual module. If you wish to install any of these modules on your site, clone the repo locally and move each subdirectory to your `modules` directory.

Please see the [Drupal SDK repo](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/edge-integrations-drupal-sdk) if you're looking for official developer documentation.
